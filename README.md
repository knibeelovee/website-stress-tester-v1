# Ethical Network Stress Test Tool

## Overview

The **Ethical Network Stress Test Tool** is a software solution designed for simulating network traffic to assess server performance. It sends controlled UDP packets to a target server for a specified period to simulate stress under high traffic conditions. The tool is designed to test the server's resilience and identify potential bottlenecks in the network.

## Important:

This tool is strictly for **ethical and educational purposes only**. It is intended for use on servers where you have **explicit permission** from the server administrator to perform stress tests. Unauthorized use of this tool is **illegal** and may result in **legal consequences**.

## Features

- **Simulated Network Traffic**: Simulates multiple bots sending packets to the target server.
- **Customizable Test Parameters**: Allows you to set the number of bots, target server IP/port, and the duration of the test.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the rate of requests per bot to prevent overwhelming the network.
- **Multithreading Support**: Uses multithreading to simulate multiple bots concurrently for a more accurate load test.
- **Ethical Use**: Emphasizes ethical testing, ensuring that the user has permission to test the target server.

## Ethical and Legal Responsibility

### Before You Use This Tool:

The following guidelines and responsibilities are critical to ensure you use this tool in an ethical and legal manner. **Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in severe consequences, including legal action.**

1. **Explicit Permission**:
   - **You must have explicit, written permission from the server owner or administrator** to run this tool on their server. Testing without permission is illegal and considered a violation of computer network laws.
   - Running this tool on unauthorized servers may result in **criminal prosecution, civil lawsuits, and significant fines**. It is your responsibility to verify that you have received permission before conducting any tests.

2. **Educational Purposes**:
   - This tool is strictly intended for **educational purposes** or in a **controlled environment** where the server is specifically set up to undergo stress testing. It should never be used for malicious activities, including but not limited to:
     - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
     - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
     - Disrupting the availability of services
     - Any form of cyber attack or unauthorized access
   - **Misuse of this tool** may lead to criminal charges, including hacking and network disruption.

3. **Malicious Use**:
   - **Do not use this tool to overwhelm or damage servers without permission.**
   - **Using this tool for malicious activities such as unauthorized testing, hacking, or cyber vandalism is strictly prohibited.**
   - If used to disrupt public services or interfere with networks without consent, **legal actions** will be taken against the user.

4. **Do Not Overwhelm Public Servers**:
   - Always ensure that the server you are testing is **prepared** and capable of handling stress tests.
   - Never run this tool on **public servers**, **production environments**, or any servers that are **not specifically set up** for testing purposes. Overloading or harming a public server can impact other users and cause significant disruption to service.

5. **Respect for Privacy and Confidentiality**:
   - Ensure that you do not inadvertently test or interact with servers that contain sensitive information or data that you do not have permission to access.
   - **Do not test on any server that holds private, classified, or proprietary data** unless you have clear and explicit consent from the rightful owner.
