# Ethical Network Stress Test Tool

## Overview
The **Ethical Network Stress Test Tool** is a software solution designed for simulating network traffic to assess server performance. It sends controlled UDP packets to a target server for a specified period to simulate stress under high traffic conditions. The tool is designed to test the server's resilience and identify potential bottlenecks in the network.

### **Important:**
This tool is **strictly for ethical and educational purposes only**. It is intended for use on servers where you have explicit **permission** from the server administrator to perform stress tests. **Unauthorized use of this tool is illegal** and may result in legal consequences.

## Features
- **Simulated Network Traffic**: Simulates multiple bots sending packets to the target server.
- **Customizable Test Parameters**: Allows you to set the number of bots, target server IP/port, and the duration of the test.
- **Rate Limiting**: Controls the rate of requests per bot to prevent overwhelming the network.
- **Multithreading Support**: Uses multithreading to simulate multiple bots concurrently for a more accurate load test.
- **Ethical Use**: Emphasizes ethical testing, ensuring that the user has permission to test the target server.
